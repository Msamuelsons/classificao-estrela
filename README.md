# Star Classification Using Machine Learning

This project involves the classification of stars using various machine learning algorithms. The goal is to predict the class of stars based on their attributes. The code provided performs data preprocessing, applies different machine learning algorithms, and evaluates their performance through cross-validation.

## Getting Started

To get started, you need to have Python and the required libraries installed. You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
